1. 1D convolution involves sliding a filter (like the Sobel filter) over a row or column of an image. When the filter encounters a rapid change in intensity, it produces a large positive or negative value. These values indicate edges, where there's a sharp transition between image features. Applying a threshold can help distinguish meaningful edges from noise. Although 2D convolution is more common for edge detection, 1D convolution can still capture certain edge-like features along a single direction.

2. Increasing Epochs and Validation Error:

Increasing epochs can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes training data noise.
To prevent increasing validation error, use techniques like early stopping, regularization, data augmentation, and simpler models.
Mini-Batch SGD vs. Batch GD:

Mini-batch SGD computes gradients using small subsets of data, leading to faster convergence.
Benefits include efficient computation, noise smoothing for regularization, optimal learning rates, and adaptability to dynamic landscapes.
Challenges involve choosing batch size and handling learning rate schedules.
Choice depends on resources, dataset size, and problem specifics.
